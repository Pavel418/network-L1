# Network Algorithms Project for L1 Students of UFAZ

Welcome to the Network Algorithms Project repository for L1 students of UFAZ! This repository serves as a resource for students to learn about network algorithms through practical implementation exercises.

## Overview

This project is designed to help L1 students of UFAZ understand various network algorithms through hands-on coding exercises. Network algorithms are fundamental in computer science and are widely used in various domains such as network routing, graph theory, and optimization problems.

In this repository, you will find:

- **Implementation Exercises:** Practical implementation exercises for various network algorithms.
- **Documentation:** Detailed explanations, documentation, and references for each algorithm implemented.
- **Sample Data:** Sample datasets to test and validate your implementations.
- **Resources:** Additional learning resources such as textbooks, research papers, and online tutorials.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ufaz-network-algorithms/project.git
   ```

2. **Explore the Contents:** Once cloned, explore the contents of the repository. You'll find folders for implementation exercises, documentation, sample data, and resources.

3. **Choose an Algorithm:** Choose an algorithm you want to learn or implement. Each algorithm is contained within its own folder along with documentation and sample data.

4. **Start Implementing:** Follow the instructions provided in the documentation to implement the algorithm of your choice. You can use the provided sample data for testing and validation.

5. **Collaborate:** Feel free to collaborate with your peers. You can work together on implementing algorithms, discussing concepts, and sharing insights.

6. **Contribute:** If you have any improvements, suggestions, or new algorithms to add, feel free to contribute to the project by opening a pull request. Contributions from students are highly encouraged!
